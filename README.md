 Car Price Prediction Model
📌 Project Overview

The Car Price Prediction Model is a machine learning project that predicts the selling price of a car based on various features such as brand, model year, fuel type, transmission, mileage, and ownership details. This project helps users estimate a fair car price using data-driven insights.

🎯 Objective

To build an end-to-end machine learning model for predicting car prices

To perform data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation

To gain hands-on experience in regression-based ML problems
